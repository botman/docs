## Introduction
BotMan comes with a thorough middleware system, which is flexible and powerful. It allows you to hook custom integration logic into multiple parts of the chatbot lifecycle, such as receiving messages, matching message patterns and sending messages back to the user. Every available middleware comes with an interface that your middleware class can implement, so you can compose your own middleware classes, the way you need them.

## Lifecycle

This chart shows you the lifecycle of the incoming chatbot requests and each steps they go through:

## Received Middleware
The `received` middleware can be used to manipulate all incoming messaging service requests. This can for example be used to pre-process the incoming data and send it to a natural language processing tool, such as API.ai or RASA NLU. Since the `received` middleware needs to be applied to all incoming requests, it needs to be defined globally.

### Example middleware class

This exampe `received` middleware takes the incoming message and adds some extra information to it, which can be used later throughout your chatbot application.
As multiple middleware classes can be applied, make sure to return a call to `$next` with the incoming message as a parameter.

```php
use BotMan\BotMan\Interfaces\Middleware\Received;

class CustomReceivedMiddleware implements Received
{
    /**
     * Handle an incoming message.
     *
     * @param IncomingMessage $message
     * @param callable $next
     * @param BotMan $bot
     *
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function received(IncomingMessage $message, $next, BotMan $bot)
    {
        $message->addExtras('custom_message_information', 'my custom value');
        return $next($message);
    }
}
```

### Applying the middleware
To apply your custom `received` middleware, you may simply add it to the middleware stack using the `$botman->middleware->received` method.
Make sure to call this method before you call the `listen()` method, as the middleware won't be loaded otherwise.

```php
$middleware = new CustomReceivedMiddleware();
$botman->middleware->received($middleware);
```

<a id="captured-middleware"></a>
## Captured Middleware
The `captured` middleware processes incoming answers when the current user is inside a conversation flow. This middleware will only be executed when your user is currently in a conversation and gives an answer to one of your conversation questions.
Since the `captured` middleware needs to be applied to all incoming requests, it needs to be defined globally.

### Example middleware class

This exampe `captured` middleware takes the incoming message and adds some extra information to it, which can be used later throughout your chatbot application.
As multiple middleware classes can be applied, make sure to return a call to `$next` with the incoming message as a parameter.

```php
use BotMan\BotMan\Interfaces\Middleware\Captured;

class CustomCapturedMiddleware implements Captured
{
    /**
     * Handle a captured message.
     *
     * @param IncomingMessage $message
     * @param callable $next
     * @param BotMan $bot
     *
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function captured(IncomingMessage $message, $next, BotMan $bot)
    {
        $message->addExtras('custom_message_information', 'my custom value');
        return $next($message);
    }
}
```

### Applying the middleware
To apply your custom `captured` middleware, you may simply add it to the middleware stack using the `$botman->middleware->captured` method.
Make sure to call this method before you call the `listen()` method, as the middleware won't be loaded otherwise.

```php
$middleware = new CustomCapturedMiddleware();
$botman->middleware->captured($middleware);
```

<a id="matching-middleware"></a>
## Matching Middleware
The `matching` middleware defines how the messages will be matched. It receives the result of the regular expression check and can perform additional checks too. This method is useful when testing incoming messages against natural language processing results - such as intents. This middleware can be applied per message that should be heard from BotMan.

### Example middleware class

This exampe `matching` middleware takes the incoming message and checks not only for the regular expression match - but also checks that the message was sent from a specific user. Every BotMan commands under this middleware will only be heard, when the correct pattern is sent **and** the correct user sends the message. Otherwise BotMan will not call the command callback.

```php
use BotMan\BotMan\Interfaces\Middleware\Matching;

class CustomMatchingMiddleware implements Matching
{
    /**
     * @param IncomingMessage $message
     * @param string $pattern
     * @param bool $regexMatched Indicator if the regular expression was matched too
     * @return bool
     */
    public function matching(IncomingMessage $message, $pattern, $regexMatched)
    {
        return $regexMatched && $message->getSender() === 'Administrator';
    }
}
```

### Applying the middleware
To apply your custom `matching` middleware, you may either group multiple commands to use this middleware using the `group` method, or only apply the middleware to specific commands using the `middleware` method. Unless the other middlewares available, the `matching` middleware is not applied globally, but on a per command level.

```php
$middleware = new CustomMatchingMiddleware();

// Let single command use this matching middleware
$botman->hears('keyword', function ($bot) {
	//
})->middleware($middleware);

// Let multiple commands use this matching middleware
$botman->group(['middleware' => $middleware], function ($botman) {
    $botman->hears('command one', function ($bot) { });
    $botman->hears('command two', function ($bot) { });
});
```

## Heard Middleware
The `heard` middleware works similar to how the `received` middleware works. It also processes the incoming message, but unlike the `received` middleware, the `heard` middleware will only be executed when the message was actually matched.

### Example middleware class

This exampe `heard` middleware takes the incoming message and adds some extra information to it, which can be used later throughout your chatbot application.
As multiple middleware classes can be applied, make sure to return a call to `$next` with the incoming message as a parameter.

```php
use BotMan\BotMan\Interfaces\Middleware\Heard;

class CustomCapturedMiddleware implements Heard
{
    /**
     * Handle a message that was successfully heard, but not processed yet.
     *
     * @param IncomingMessage $message
     * @param callable $next
     * @param BotMan $bot
     *
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function heard(IncomingMessage $message, $next, BotMan $bot)
    {
        $message->addExtras('custom_message_information', 'my custom value');
        return $next($message);
    }
}
```

### Applying the middleware
To apply your custom `heard` middleware, you may simply add it to the middleware stack using the `$botman->middleware->heard` method.
Make sure to call this method before you call the `listen()` method, as the middleware won't be loaded otherwise.

```php
$middleware = new CustomHeardMiddleware();
$botman->middleware->heard($middleware);
```

<a id="sending-middleware"></a>
## Sending Middleware
The `sending` middleware gets called before each message is sent out to the recipient. You can use this middleware to process outgoing messages and track every message that you send, for example using an analytics service.
You can also manipulate the outgoing payload data before it gets sent to the messaging service.

### Example middleware class

This exampe `sending` middleware simply logs the outgoing payload data into a file called log.txt.

```php
use BotMan\BotMan\Interfaces\Middleware\Sending;

class CustomCapturedMiddleware implements Sending
{
    /**
     * Handle an outgoing message payload before/after it
     * hits the message service.
     *
     * @param mixed $payload
     * @param callable $next
     * @param BotMan $bot
     *
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function sending($payload, $next, BotMan $bot)
    {
        file_put_contents('log.txt', print_r($payload, true));
        return $next($payload);
    }
}
```

### Applying the middleware
To apply your custom `sending` middleware, you may simply add it to the middleware stack using the `$botman->middleware->sending` method.
Make sure to call this method before you call the `listen()` method, as the middleware won't be loaded otherwise.

```php
$middleware = new CustomSendingMiddleware();
$botman->middleware->sending($middleware);
```
