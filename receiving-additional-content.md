## Introduction

BotMan does not only allow you to listen for incoming textual messages, but also gives you the ability to listen for incoming images, videos, audio messages and locations.

<a id="images"></a>
## Listen for images

Making your bot listen to incoming images is easy. Just use the `receivesImages` method on the BotMan instance. All received images will be passed to the callback as a second argument.

The images returned will be an array of `Image` objects.

```php
use BotMan\BotMan\Messages\Attachments\Image;

$bot->receivesImages(function($bot, $images) {

    foreach ($images as $image) {

        $url = $image->getUrl(); // The direct url
        $title = $image->getTitle(); // The title, if available
        $payload = $image->getPayload(); // The original payload
    }
});
```

<a id="videos"></a>
## Listen for videos

Just like images, you can use the `receivesVideos` method on the BotMan instance to listen for incoming video file uploads. All received videos will be passed to the callback as a second argument.

The videos returned will be an array of `Video` objects.

```php
use BotMan\BotMan\Messages\Attachments\Video;

$bot->receivesVideos(function($bot, $videos) {

    foreach ($videos as $video) {

        $url = $video->getUrl(); // The direct url
        $payload = $video->getPayload(); // The original payload
    }
});
```

<a id="audio"></a>
## Listen for audio

Just like images, you can use the `receivesAudio` method on the BotMan instance to listen for incoming audio file uploads. All received audio files will be passed to the callback as a second argument.

The audio files returned will be an array of `Audio` objects.

```php
use BotMan\BotMan\Messages\Attachments\Audio;

$bot->receivesAudio(function($bot, $audios) {

    foreach ($audios as $audio) {

        $url = $audio->getUrl(); // The direct url
        $payload = $audio->getPayload(); // The original payload
    }
});
```

<a id="files"></a>
## Listen for files

Just like images, you can use the `receivesFiles` method on the BotMan instance to listen for incoming file uploads. All received files will be passed to the callback as a second argument.

The files returned will be an array of `File` objects.

```php
use BotMan\BotMan\Messages\Attachments\File;

$bot->receivesFiles(function($bot, $files) {

    foreach ($files as $file) {

        $url = $file->getUrl(); // The direct url
        $payload = $file->getPayload(); // The original payload
    }
});
```

<a id="locations"></a>
## Listen for locations

Some messaging services also allow your bot users to send their GPS location to your bot. You can listen for these location calls using the `receivesLocation` method on the BotMan instance.

The method will pass a `Location` object to the callback method.

```php
use BotMan\BotMan\Messages\Attachments\Location;

$bot->receivesLocation(function($bot, Location $location) {
    $lat = $location->getLatitude();
    $lng = $location->getLongitude();
});
```

## Supported Drivers

Not all drivers support receiving attachments, or because of the lack of reference API, or because it has not yet been implemented in the driver itself.
